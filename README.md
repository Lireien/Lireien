Hi there, I’m Ana and I'm glad to see you here ;)

According to template suggested...

I’m interested in dogs, music, travelling and learning. 
I’m currently learning Front-end science, and I should say, that learning will be endless.  
I'm TeachMeSkills graduate and insanely grateful to this school
